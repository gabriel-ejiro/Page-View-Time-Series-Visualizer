In this project I will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. 

I will be using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03 in order to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
